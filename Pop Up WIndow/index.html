                    A “model” has the same meaning in as in the real world; it is a program which “models” some kind of behaviour (like say climatic changes).

“Modal” refers to an application creating a new window, and requiring the user to complete/close the new window before accessing the first window again. So for example the .Net MessageBox is a modal dialog box - you have to press “OK” or “Cancel” before you can go back to the main window.
